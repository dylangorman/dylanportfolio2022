            <p>
              Hello, I am Dylan, based in South Liverpool. UK. I have recently
              completed a 12-week Master Coding Course and I am looking to start
              a new career path after being made redundant from my previous
              occupation as an Audio/Visual Rental Operations Assistant. I have
              Several years experience as a Warehouse Manager and experience in
              Operations in the Live Music Rental Industry. The Master Coding
              Course has introduced me to new languages such as HTML, CSS,
              Javascript alongside using Libraries and Frameworks such as React,
              BootStrap and Node. and learning principles like Agile using
              systems like Kanban/Trello. I have also learnt about backend
              databases using Mongo DB, SQL, Express and have some experience
              with programs such as D-Beaver and Insomnia. Most of the course
              was learnt using VS-Code using Git and GitHub. The last 2 weeks of
              the course we had to create, design, and produce a working Full
              Stack app. The small team I was in produced an original App which
              I led the design side. I have a great passion for UI and UX
              product design and would like to further this passion into a
              long-term career.

              I have many passions in life. I am married and have two young
              children and we do so many activities together, from working on
              our new allotment, arts and crafts to football and yoga. We like
              long walks, adventure holidays, and city breaks. Anglesey and
              Paris being two of our favorite places to visit. I have been
              writing and playing music for over 25 years and have a passion for
              art and design, DIY and decorating and I also enjoy fixing things
              around the house and for friends. From Amplifiers to laptops and
              anything I can get my hands on. Problem solving has always been my
              raison d'etre! I am an official Carer for my wife who has
              Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis and an Anachroid Cyst. So, a lot
              of my day-to-day life is balancing caring for her, work and
              looking after our children. Working from home for most of the week
              is a really important factor for me. I also like craft beer and
              coffee and I am a vegetarian.
